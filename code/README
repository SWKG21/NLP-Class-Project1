6 code files are included in this folder:

utils.py: this file gathers some tool functions which are used in other files.

computeFeatures.py: this file compute feature values by calling functions in utils.py

models.py: this file gathers functions for different machine learning models (tuning, training, prediction)

feature_engineering.py: this is another full feature engineering procedure

gaussianSimilarity.py: this file is specifically for calculating the Gaussian document representation and the document similarity based this representation (centroid similarity and covariance similarity)

graphAlgorithm.py: this file calculates some graphical features, and try to predict links just with these graphical information without considering textual information.
